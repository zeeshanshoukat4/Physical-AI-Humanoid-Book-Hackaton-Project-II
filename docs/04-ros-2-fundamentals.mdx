# 4. ROS 2 Fundamentals

The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. ROS 2 is the latest iteration, offering improved real-time capabilities, security, and multi-robot support. This chapter introduces the core concepts of ROS 2.

## What is ROS 2?

ROS 2 provides libraries, tools, and conventions for developing complex robot applications. It's not an operating system in the traditional sense, but a meta-operating system that sits on top of a conventional OS (like Linux, Windows, or macOS).

## Key Concepts

*   **Nodes**: Executables that perform computation.
*   **Topics**: Named buses over which nodes exchange messages (publishers and subscribers).
*   **Services**: Request/reply communication patterns between nodes.
*   **Actions**: Long-running goal-oriented communication for complex tasks (e.g., moving to a target location).
*   **ROS 2 Graph**: The network of nodes communicating via topics, services, and actions.

## Example: Simple ROS 2 Publisher (Conceptual)

This is a conceptual representation, as a full ROS 2 example requires a ROS 2 environment setup.

```python
# Conceptual Python code for a ROS 2 publisher
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from std_msgs.msg import String

class MinimalPublisher(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('minimal_publisher')
        self.publisher_ = self.create_publisher(String, 'topic', 10)
        timer_period = 0.5  # seconds
        self.timer = self.create_timer(timer_period, self.timer_callback)
        self.i = 0

    def timer_callback(self):
        msg = String()
        msg.data = f'Hello ROS 2! {self.i}'
        self.publisher_.publish(msg)
        self.get_logger().info(f'Publishing: "{msg.data}"')
        self.i += 1

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    minimal_publisher = MinimalPublisher()
    rclpy.spin(minimal_publisher)
    minimal_publisher.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
