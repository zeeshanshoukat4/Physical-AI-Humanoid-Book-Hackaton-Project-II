# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Technology Stack: Next.js and TypeScript
The project will be built using Next.js for the frontend framework and TypeScript for type-safe code. Next.js provides a robust framework for server-rendered React applications, which is ideal for a content-focused website. TypeScript enhances developer productivity and code quality.

### II. Modern & Engaging User Experience
The website must feature a stylish, dark theme with a dynamic background and neon accents. It must include a modern navigation bar and a floating chatbot button for user engagement. A visually appealing and interactive design is crucial for engaging users with educational content.

### III. Content Structure: Chapters
The website will present the educational content in a structured format of 10 chapters, derived from a Physical AI syllabus. Organizing content into chapters provides a clear learning path for users.

### IV. Core Functionality: Navigation and Interaction
The homepage must have a "Start Reading" button leading to the content. A chatbot button should be present on the website. Clear calls-to-action and interactive elements improve user navigation and engagement.

## Governance
This Constitution defines the project's foundational principles. All development artifacts, including specifications, plans, and code, must adhere to these principles. Amendments require documented approval and a clear migration path for existing work.
